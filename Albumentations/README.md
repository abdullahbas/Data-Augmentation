#Here I showed augmentation  of images with and without bounding boxes using PyTorch, Tensorflow, Albumentations and Imgaug. Enjoy !Augmentation is a very effective method to make your method more robust.  As a matter of fact if you try to create models that Works quite well you should consider to use data augmentation. #First  install all of the requirements.******`pip install -r requirements.txt`#*****_"Any fool can know.

I automated the process and I told myself if I set probability  0 for fliplr it will return original image. Sorry I am too lazy to code if else for naming. ![Rotate](https://github.com/abdullahbas/Data-Augmentation/blob/main/augmented.png?raw=true)### Using imgaug 2 Same code but different output because of the probabilities..![Channel Shuff](https://github.com/abdullahbas/Data-Augmentation/blob/main/augmented2.png?raw=true)#
